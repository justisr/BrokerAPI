# BrokerAPI - A transaction abstraction library 

An abstraction layer enabling communication between unlimited unknown callers and unlimited unknown implementations which facilitate transactions of any object, with integrated pre and post transaction events, as well as end-user control over implementation inclusion, prioritization and greediness.

It's a lightweight but powerful library for instantly enabling extensive cross compatibility and flexibility without the overhead, 3rd party dependencies, version reliance, or licensing burdens and conflicts.

## Include with Maven

        <artifactId>BrokerAPI</artifactId>
        <version>master-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
Using `master-SNAPSHOT` in place of a version will always provide you the latest build for the master branch. Alternatively, use the short form of your target commit hash.

### JavaDocs 
Here you can find the latest version of BrokerAPIâ€™s public [JavaDocs](http://jitpack.io/com/github/justisr/BrokerAPI/latest/javadoc/).

## Implementations
Broker currently has a [Spigot](https://github.com/justisr/Broker-Spigot) server implementation and a Sponge server implementation is in the works.
This library was designed with the present needs of the Minecraft plugin development community in mind, but with outside future use potential in heart.

Seek details and examples of API usage in the README of the implementing project relevant to you.

## Contributing
Public classes and methods should ensure JavaDoc validity and maintain backwards compatibility at all times. For major changes, please create an issue to propose your idea.

Libraries specific to individual implementations should be avoided. Implementation details belong in the repo dedicated to that specific implementation of the API.
