			A transaction abstraction library | <a href="https://github.com/justisr/BrokerAPI">[Github Repository]</a><br>
			<br>
			Any software looking to register a {@link com.gmail.justisroot.broker.Broker} or make a transaction through one will require this and only this library.<br>
			<br>
			An implementation of BrokerAPI is only required when interacting with events is desired.<br>
			If that is your use case, please refer to the specific implementation you're looking to depend on.
